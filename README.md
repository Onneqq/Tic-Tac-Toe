## Check List :white_check_mark:
- At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe demonstrating planning - Due by end of the day :white_check_mark:
- A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet :white_check_mark:
- A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo :white_check_mark:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project :white_check_mark:
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. :white_check_mark:

## Cool Tech :rocket: :rocket:
- Languages used: HTML, CSS & JS
- CSS Animations/transitions
- Any cool solutions to problems found

## A Bugs Life :ant: :bug: :beetle:
- Need to figure out margins/border of HTML/body - background image is causing a scroll wheel to appear when I try apply the image to the entire screen using 100vh/100vw.
- Draw condition causing game to end early.
- Need reset button to set player 1 as starting player.

## Lessons Learnt :bulb: :bulb:
- Dabbled with some Mermaid flow chart creation!
- Complete the structure of HTML/CSS first, helps to keep things simple.
- Plan, plan and more planning - breaking down each step into chunks of code helped a lot.

## Future Features :gem:
- Custom styling/animations - want to use a Mario theme
- Add audio when user selection is made
- Win animation of some kind
