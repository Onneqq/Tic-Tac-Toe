## Planning :construction_worker:

- Approach: 
- Day 1: Complete basic HTML and CSS structure & JS code needed to meet minimum requirements.
- Day 2: Add CSS Keyframes and other additional styling. If there's time, add sound effects to the game. Fix any remaining bugs. Will finish up revising this README.md.
- Flowchart of logic (Work in Progress)

## Check List :white_check_mark:
- At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe demonstrating planning - Due by end of the day :white_check_mark:
- A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet :white_check_mark:
- A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo :white_check_mark:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project :white_check_mark:
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. :white_check_mark:

## Cool Tech :rocket: :rocket:
- Languages used: HTML, CSS & JS
- CSS Animations/transitions
- Any cool solutions to problems found

## A Bugs Life :ant: :bug: :beetle:
- Need to figure out margins/border of HTML/body - background image is causing a scroll wheel to appear when I try apply the image to the entire screen using 100vh/100vw. - Fixed :white_check_mark:
- Draw condition causing game to end early. - Fixed :white_check_mark:
- Need reset button to set player 1 as starting player. Fixed :white_check_mark:
- Scaling issue, smaller screens don't work currently. - Fixed :white_check_mark:

## Lessons Learnt :bulb: :bulb:
- Dabbled with some Mermaid flow chart creation!
- Complete the structure of HTML/CSS first, helps to keep things simple.
- Plan, plan and more planning - breaking down each step into chunks of code helped a lot.
- Learnt the hard way about mobile first, using Flex to create a 3x3 made it difficult to scale later on. It also prevented me from adding certain CSS transitions/effects to the game itself as the scaling became too complex. 

## Future Features :gem:
- Custom styling/animations - want to use a Mario theme :white_check_mark:
- Add audio :white_check_mark:
- Win animation of some kind
